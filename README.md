Sometimes we can call him the "project development team lead" for a specific project.
He's responsible for the following:

- Making sure that the developed solution meets the designed architecture.
- Making sure that the developed solution meets the functional requirements.
- Participate in choosing the right design patterns for solving problems.

Solution architect would be guided by the "Enterprise architect".

Enterprise architect is the very highly abstracted architect responsible for the following:
